Data from Bondora downloaded is not included here, as the filesize is too big for Github.

Folder 'Models' contains all Jupyter notebooks where models were trained.

- 1 File for the Baseline Model
- 10 Files each including one Model trained with reweighing and one Model trained with reject option based classification

All other files outsides of this Folder are for data preparation, EDA, and bias measurement.
